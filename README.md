# rj32

A 16-bit RISC CPU with 32 instructions built with [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).

## Description

This is a CPU built from scratch in a visual way using a digital circuit simulator called [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital). This is then able to be exported to verilog or VHDL and that can be converted into a digital circuit that can run on an [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array).

I have built a couple CPUs before, but this time I decided to record it as a youtube series. I start out being a bit of a youtube n00b, but the quality hopefully gets better as the series goes on.
