# rj32 Video Display Processor

A retro Video Display Processor (VDP) for hobby CPUs.

# Goal

- get pixels on the screen
- faster digital simulation
- get verilator and fpga working

# Video

- What does a viewer most want to know on this topic?
- What do they need to know first in order to understand the rest?
- What things can be left out without affecting the viewer's goals above?

# Agenda

- demo
- framebuffer intro
-

- talk a bit about setting up a new project
- need to be able to test the circuit
- so we need to display something
- explanation of a frame buffer
- modern memory rich vs retro memory poor
- but good for speed on a modern system
-

- it's also important to get a verilator sim going and fpga
